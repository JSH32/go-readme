# go-readme : Example ReadMe.md file for Go libraries

See the original blog post for why this project exists : https://chilts.org/2017/01/10/readme-minimum-info-needed-for-your-golang-library

## Usage 

Copy the [template.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chilts/go-readme/master/template.md) file from this repo and search and replace a few things:

* `__TITLE__` : A simple name, e.g. "BoltDB", "Goth", "Slugify", "UUID", "Sessions".
* `__SLUG__` : The import name / project name, e.g. "bolt", "slugify", "uuid", "sessions", "goth".
* `__SHORT_DESC__` : Up to 7 words, e.g. "An OAuth library", "Cookie and filesystem sessions", "Turn strings into slugs".
* `__LONG_DESC__` : More info, e.g. "The key features are ...", "This library ...", "ProjectName is a ...".
* `__USERNAME__` : Your GitHub username, e.g. "chilts", "hashicorp", "gorilla".
* `__LICENSE__ : e.g. "MIT", "Apache 2.0", "BSD licensed. See the LICENSE file for details.".

Once you've done the above, scan over the readme and check for mistakes, errors, or omissions.

If your project is not on GitHub, you may have to manually edit a few of the links.
